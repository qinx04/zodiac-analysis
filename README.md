# Zodiac Insights: Unveiling Astrological Data with Python


## üåå Project Overview

The **Zodiac Insights** repository offers a unique Python-based exploration of astrological data. This project goes beyond simple lookups, demonstrating skills in **data parsing (JSON), web scraping (Beautiful Soup), and creative visualization (Turtle graphics)** to present information about Western zodiac signs and even fetch daily horoscopes.

This repository showcases an imaginative application of Python for data retrieval, manipulation, and presentation, appealing to those interested in both technology and astrology.

**Key Features Include:**

  * **Zodiac Sign Determination**: A function to accurately determine the zodiac sign based on a given birth date (day and month).
  * **Static Zodiac Data**: Utilizes a `zodiac.json` file (example needed) containing key information about each Western zodiac sign (e.g., ruling planet, element, keywords, date ranges, and potentially even associated Turtle drawing coordinates).
  * **Daily Horoscope Web Scraping**: Fetches the current daily horoscope for a specified zodiac sign from [Astrology.com](https://www.astrology.com/) using web scraping techniques.
  * **Interactive Visualization (Turtle Graphics)**: Employs the `turtle` module to create a visual representation of the zodiac wheel. Upon entering a birth date, the script can highlight the user's zodiac sign on the wheel and display relevant information.
  * **Text Formatting**: Includes functions to break long strings into readable multi-line text for display within the Turtle graphics window.


## ‚ú® Skills Demonstrated

This project highlights a diverse and engaging set of skills relevant to various technical domains:

  * **Python Programming**: Strong foundation in Python, including function definition, conditional logic, and working with data structures (dictionaries, lists).
  * **JSON Data Handling**: Ability to load and utilize data stored in JSON format.
  * **Web Scraping**: Experience using `requests` to fetch web content and `Beautiful Soup` to parse HTML and extract specific information.
  * **String Manipulation**: Skills in processing and formatting text for readability.
  * **Creative Data Visualization**: Utilizing the `turtle` graphics library for generating visual output based on data.
  * **Algorithmic Thinking**: Implementing the logic for zodiac sign determination based on date ranges.
  * **Modular Design**: Structuring the code into well-defined functions for clarity and reusability.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  * **Python 3.x**
  * **`json`**: For reading and parsing the `zodiac.json` data file.
  * **`turtle`**: Python's built-in graphics library for creating visualizations.
  * **`requests`**: For making HTTP requests to fetch web page content.
  * **`beautifulsoup4` (or `bs4`)**: For parsing HTML from the Astrology.com website.


## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore the Zodiac Insights on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thexqin/zodiac-analysis.git
    cd zodiac-analysis
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

4.  **Obtain the `zodiac.json` file:**
    *(**Crucially, you need to create a `zodiac.json` file with the structure expected by your script. Provide an example of this file structure below.**)*

    **Example `zodiac.json` Structure:**

    ```json
    {
      "western_zodiac": {
        "Aries": {
          "gloss": "The Ram",
          "unicode_symbol": "‚ôà",
          "element": "Fire",
          "approximate_start_date": "March 21",
          "approximate_end_date": "April 19",
          "keywords": ["Energetic", "Courageous", "Impetuous"],
          "longitude_end": 30 # Example for Turtle positioning
        },
        "Taurus": {
          "gloss": "The Bull",
          "unicode_symbol": "‚ôâ",
          "element": "Earth",
          "approximate_start_date": "April 20",
          "approximate_end_date": "May 20",
          "keywords": ["Practical", "Sensual", "Stubborn"],
          "longitude_end": 60
        },
        // ... add definitions for other zodiac signs ...
        "Pisces": {
          "gloss": "The Fish",
          "unicode_symbol": "‚ôì",
          "element": "Water",
          "approximate_start_date": "February 19",
          "approximate_end_date": "March 20",
          "keywords": ["Compassionate", "Artistic", "Escapist"],
          "longitude_end": 360
        }
      },
      "eastern_zodiac": {
        // ... (You can expand this with Eastern zodiac data if you like) ...
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **Run the main script:**
    Execute the Python script (e.g., `zodiac_analyzer.py`). The Turtle graphics window will open, and you will be prompted to enter your birth month and day.

    ```bash
    python zodiac_analyzer.py
    ```

    The script will then:

      * Determine your zodiac sign.
      * Highlight it (if you implement the wheel drawing).
      * Display information about your sign.
      * Fetch and display your daily horoscope.


## ‚ú® Interactive Experience

Upon running the script, you'll be greeted with a Turtle graphics window. After providing your birth date, the application will:

1.  Visually indicate your zodiac sign (if you've added the zodiac wheel drawing logic).
2.  Display key attributes of your zodiac sign, such as its symbol, ruling element, and associated keywords.
3.  Fetch your personalized daily horoscope from Astrology.com and present it in the Turtle window.

*(**Consider adding a simple visual of what the Turtle graphics output might look like, even a text-based representation if a screenshot isn't feasible directly in the README.**)*
